# learnR

This repository is for teaching R to beginners using principles from Hadley Wickham's **R For Data Science** book. The approach adopted is to work on a real dataset 
rather than a toy dataset and the data for this repository comes from [here](https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/Government/Animal-Shelter-Intake-and-Outcome/924a-vesw/data).
